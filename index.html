                <h2>0. Introduction</h2>
                <b>Study Shuffle</b> is a HCI project where the goal is to solve an everyday problem using the Arduino interface. Study Shuffle addresses the problem that many students face while attempting to study: maintaining focus and finding the
                perfect study playlist.
                <div class="float-left"><img src="assets/gif1.gif"></div> The environment in which we work or study in plays a large part in how efficient we are. By providing students and workers with soothing, ambient music paired with relaxing scenery and a candy reward with
                each successful work session, Study Shuffle helps to reinforce good study habits while laying out a calming work environment. Our application was designed to help people who may have short attention spans and are easily distracted by having
                them follow a simple time management system that allows them to work with the time they have - rather than against it. This page documents the iterative design process that lead to our final product.

                <h2>1. Design Ideas</h2>
                The first iteration of our design process consisted of each group member sketching 10+ ideas. Here, our top 5 sketches out of the 30+ are shown. <iframe scrolling="no" class="slider" src="slider1.html" title="W3Schools Free Online Web Tutorials">

                From the aforementioned 5 chosen sketches as inspiration, the group member drew a total of 10 refined sketches. See the slider below to view them all!

                <div class="float-left"><img src="assets/gif2.gif"></div>
                After deciding on the idea of playing random TV Shows from Netflix, we set out to program our first iteration. A sizable amount of time was spent setting up the hardware. After that we hit a hard roadblock with communicating with the Netflix API. We did
                a hard pivot from random TV Shows to selecting ambient, studying YouTube videos using the Arduino and a controller with a personalized board. We then shifted our focus to solving the everyday problem problem of quickly transitioning into
                a state of deep focus to effectively complete work/study tasks by immersing ourselves into the proper environment. We included presets for the study music and also included functionality that allowed for snack dispensing.
